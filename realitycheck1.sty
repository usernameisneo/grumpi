  Project Reality Check – Raw + Honest Edition
What is the current state?
What's Working:
• Core server architecture - FastAPI-based server with proper async handling
• Configuration system - ConfigGuard-based robust config management
• Enhanced LM Studio binding - RTX 3060 12GB optimized, production-ready
• OpenRouter binding - 1000+ line implementation, working with proper model
sorting
• Novita binding - LLM + image generation, comprehensive implementation
• Gemini binding - Advanced tier features, safety controls
• Test infrastructure - Comprehensive pytest suite with integration tests
• Documentation - Extensive docs, configuration guides, API reference
What's Broken/Problematic:
• UI components - DevOps page and settings binder selection non-functional
• Binding integration - Only LM Studio actually works in practice, others fail
• Web UI authentication - API key requirements blocking local UI access
• Model filtering - Server presents all 500+ models instead of intelligent filtering
• Production readiness - Despite claims, real-world testing reveals integration
issues
Repository Status:
• Single repo: already cloned 
• Version control: Git repo with proper structure
• Packaging: Proper pyproject.toml with dependencies
What are the top 3 things you keep pushing away, bc too complicated?
Be brutally honest  what's been sitting there forever, untouched because it feels like a
mess or just… too much?
1. Web UI Integration Hell - The Vue.js frontend authentication flow is a
nightmare. Local server shouldn't need API keys for its own UI, but fixing this
requires understanding the entire auth middleware stack and potentially breaking
existing API security.
2. Binding System Reality Gap - There's a massive disconnect between the
"production-ready" binding implementations and actual functionality. The zoo
adapter system, binding manager, and instance configuration create a complex web
where things work in isolation but fail in integration.
3. Intelligent Routing Implementation - The routing system is extensively
documented and architected but the actual implementation of strategy-based
model selection is incomplete. It's a complex decision engine that requires
understanding model capabilities, hardware constraints, and user preferences
simultaneously.
What are the next 3 things on your to-do, in any random order?
No need for a priority list here. Just name the next 3 things that are coming up, no
matter the chaos:
1. Fix Web UI Authentication - Make the built-in web interface work without API
key barriers for local access
2. Live Binding Testing - Actually test all the "production-ready" bindings with real
API endpoints and hardware
3. Create Honest Status Documentation - Write a plan.md that tracks what
actually works vs. what's claimed to work
If you had 1 thing you would do differently if you had to start from scratch, what would
that be?
Go ahead and extend it to 3 if something comes to mind.
1. Start with ONE working binding - Instead of implementing 4+ bindings
simultaneously, get one binding LM Studio working perfectly end-to-end, then
clone that pattern. The current approach created integration debt.
2. Test-Driven Development - Write integration tests FIRST, then implement
features. The current test suite was added after implementation, missing critical
integration failures.
3. Skip the Web UI initially - Focus on API-first development with proper CLI tools.
The web UI added complexity without providing essential functionality for a routing
server.
In what department do you lack…
a) Skill – Where do you know you're under-equipped, technically or creatively?
• Frontend Integration - Vue.js authentication flows and API integration patterns
• Production DevOps - Docker deployment, monitoring, and scaling strategies
• Hardware Optimization - VRAM management and GPU resource allocation
algorithms
b) Resources – What's missing that keeps you from reaching the next step?
• Real Testing Environment - Need actual API keys and hardware setups to test
bindings properly
• User Feedback - No real users testing the routing decisions and model selection
• Time for Systematic Debugging - Current approach is "build more features"
instead of "fix existing ones"
Last question When would you consider the server shipping ready?
How would you know the time has come?
"Shipping ready" means:
1. 48-Hour Stability Test - Server runs continuously for 48 hours handling real
requests without crashes or memory leaks
2. All Claimed Features Actually Work - Every binding listed as "productionready" can successfully generate text/images with real API calls
3. Intelligent Routing Delivers - The routing system makes demonstrably better
model choices than random selection, with measurable improvements in cost,
speed, or quality
4. Honest Documentation - Documentation accurately reflects what works vs.
what's planned, with clear setup instructions that work for new users
5. Security Without Barriers - Local web UI works seamlessly while maintaining
API security for external clients
The brutal truth: Currently at maybe 40% shipping ready. The architecture is solid, but the
integration gaps and authentication issues make it unsuitable for real production use. It's
more of a "sophisticated demo" than a production server right now.\documentclass{article}
